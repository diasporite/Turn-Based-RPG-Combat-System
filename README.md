# Turn-Based-RPG-Combat-System

This is a simple turn based combat system made with C# and Unity 2019.1. Most of the work on this project was done back in August 2020. This is my first complete programming project which I made as a way to learn programming, using online resources such as documentation, forum posts and articles to help find ways to implement certain bits of functionality.

Each side can have up to 3 combatants. Turns are sorted in order of the combatants' speed stat - faster combatants will have their turns earlier than slower ones. The battle is won if all of the enemies are killed, while the battle will be lost if all of the current combatants on the player's side are killed.
